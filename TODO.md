# TODO: Transform Angular App into Modern Ars Machina Consultancy Landing Page

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Update src/app/todos/todos.component.html with modern landing page HTML structure
- [x] Update src/app/todos/todos.component.css with modern, enchanting CSS styles
- [x] Verify and update src/app/app.component.html if necessary
- [x] Test the application visually (run locally if possible) - User declined to run ng serve
- [x] Final review and adjustments (adjusted hero height for better fit, fixed navigation import error)

## Information Gathered:
- Current app is an Angular app with a todos component that displays posts from AWS Amplify backend
- todos.component.html has basic structure with company name placeholder
- todos.component.ts handles post creation and listing
- Need to transform into a modern, client-enchanting consultancy page

## Plan:
- Replace the basic HTML with a professional landing page layout
- Include hero section, about, services, contact sections
- Use modern CSS for visual appeal (gradients, animations, responsive design)
- Integrate existing post functionality subtly or in a blog section
- Ensure the page is visually stunning to enchant clients

## Dependent Files:
- src/app/todos/todos.component.html
- src/app/todos/todos.component.css
- src/app/app.component.html (if needed)

## Followup Steps:
- Run `ng serve` to test the app locally
- Use browser_action to verify the page appearance
- Make any final tweaks based on visual feedback
